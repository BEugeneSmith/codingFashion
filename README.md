# Coding Fashion
The purpose of this project to see whether the difference in Men's and Women's clothing can be described statistically. As it seems, they can! Feel free to poke around this repository or see my analysis [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BEugeneSmith7/codingFashion/blob/f77a66721de2a9784843041c5253d12344c252ac/NordstromNotebook.ipynb).  Though this project's primary goal is complete feel free to suggest changes.

Thanks!  
Eugene
