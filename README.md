The purpose of this project to see whether the difference in Men's and Women's clothing can be described statistically. The plan for now (5/31/2015) is to mine product information for cloting from Nordstrom and perform a PCA on both datasets to get an idea for the variance within each, then compare that between the two. Should historical data be available, like catalogs from the 19th century, I will look into ways of incorporating that as well. However, before that, the same approach being applied to Nordstrom product data will be applied to that of other large department stores, like Macy's.

Thanks!
