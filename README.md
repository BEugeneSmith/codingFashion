The purpose of this project to see whether the difference in Men's and Women's clothing can be described statistically. The plan for now (5/31/2015) is to mine product information for clothing from Nordstrom and perform a PCA on both datasets to get an idea for the variance within each, then compare that between the two if possible. We do, however, expect men's clothing to be more 'boring'...way more boring.

Thanks!
